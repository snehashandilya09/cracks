PROVER PHASE:\r\n *    - Prover/oracle node fetches price from TLS-enabled source\r\n *    - Commits price with cryptographic proof (simplified DECO)\r\n *    - Posts bond (MIN_PROVER_BOND = 1 ether)\r\n *\r\n * 2. DISPUTE WINDOW:\r\n *    - Price is PENDING for T_DISPUTE blocks\r\n *    - Watchtower/challengers can initiate dispute\r\n *    - Commit-reveal scheme prevents front-running challenges\r\n *\r\n * 3. BISECTION GAME:\r\n *    - If disputed, prover and challenger play bisection game\r\n *    - Game narrows disagreement in log(n) rounds\r\n *    - Example: 1M step trace → 20 rounds to single step\r\n *\r\n * 4. ONE-STEP VERIFICATION:\r\n *    - When bisection converges, verify single EVM opcode\r\n *    - On-chain verification of state transition\r\n *    - Winner takes loser's bond + reward (1.5x)\r\n *\r\n * SECURITY PROPERTIES:\r\n * ===================\r\n * ✓ Data Integrity: TLS binding prevents data forgery\r\n * ✓ Commit-Reveal: Prevents front-running of challenges\r\n * ✓ Economic Incentives: Honest behavior payoff > dishonest behavior payoff\r\n * ✓ Byzantine Safety: Dispute resolution always produces correct result\r\n * ✓ Liveness: >1/3 honest nodes can always challenge false prices\r\n
